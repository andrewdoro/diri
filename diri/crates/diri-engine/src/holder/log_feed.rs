//! Bytes on their way from the PTY pump to the output log.
//!
//! A macOS PTY hands over one kilobyte per read, so a queue of chunks carried
//! one kilobyte per entry: an allocation to hand it over, a thread wakeup to
//! receive it, and a `write(2)` to append it. At streaming rates that is tens
//! of thousands of syscalls a second per session, and a bound counted in
//! chunks was only a quarter of a megabyte of slack.
//!
//! This is one byte buffer instead. The pump appends to it, and the writer
//! swaps it for an empty one and appends the lot in one write. The writer
//! lingers briefly for a batch to build rather than waking per kilobyte. The
//! log is not on the display path (subscribers get their bytes directly) and
//! is synced only every couple of seconds, so a few milliseconds here change
//! no promise. The linger exists only while bytes are pending; an idle feed
//! parks the writer with no deadline.
