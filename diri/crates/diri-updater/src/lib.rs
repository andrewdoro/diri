//! diri's self-updater.
//!
//! Replaces what Sparkle does for the Swift app, without Sparkle: diri is a
//! Rust binary, and the Swift app's appcast carries EdDSA signatures tied to a
//! keypair this app has no way to use. The releases host is shared — the same
//! password-gated Cloudflare Worker — but diri reads a JSON feed under
//! `/diri/` and trusts Apple's Developer ID + notarization rather than a
//! project-managed key. See [`codesign`] for why.
//!
//! The flow, each step gated on the previous one:
//!
//! 1. [`Updater::check`] — fetch the feed, pick the newest eligible release.
//! 2. [`Updater::download`] — fetch the zip, match its size and sha256.
//!
//! Both fetches go to GitHub, and to the update [`mirror`] when GitHub's route
//! fails or (for the feed) is slow to answer. The mirror is held to the same
//! checks; see that module for why it cannot serve a different build.
//! 3. [`Updater::stage`] — unpack it, verify the signature against our own.
//! 4. [`Updater::install`] — hand off to the swap helper, then quit.
//!
//! Every call blocks; the app runs them on a worker thread.
