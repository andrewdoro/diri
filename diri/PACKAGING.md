# Packaging diri

The macOS and Linux packages are built natively on their oldest supported
runner. Both consume the same Rust workspace, protocol, daemon, holder, CLI,
MCP frontend, and agent manifests.

## Linux

Run this on x86_64 Linux after installing the build dependencies in
[`LINUX.md`](LINUX.md), Node.js 20 or newer, and cargo-packager 0.11.8:

```sh
cargo install cargo-packager --version 0.11.8 --locked
scripts/package-linux.sh
scripts/verify-linux-package.sh dist/linux
```

The script builds every release binary, installs the locked browser-sidecar
dependencies, validates the repository's license policy, and passes a declared
resource manifest to cargo-packager. It emits an AppImage, a Debian package,
`SHA256SUMS`, `linux-release.json`, and the third-party license inventory under
`dist/linux`. `linux-release.json` records the version, source commit,
platform, architecture, format, size, and SHA-256 digest of each artifact.

The AppImage and Debian package have the same internal layout: executables in
`usr/bin`, manifests and the browser sidecar in `usr/lib/diri`, desktop
metadata in `usr/share/applications`, and the icon under the hicolor icon
tree. The Debian package declares the glibc 2.35, fontconfig, GLib, Vulkan,
Wayland, X11/XCB, and xkbcommon runtime dependencies.

Linux packages are always built on Ubuntu 22.04 to establish the oldest
supported glibc floor, then installed and smoke-tested on clean Ubuntu 22.04
and 24.04 CI jobs. The smoke covers X11 launch, package upgrade and uninstall,
a live shell session, Engine restart/holder adoption, CLI hooks, and MCP. The
workspace job additionally launches the GUI against headless Wayland. Manual
native-GPU QA remains a release gate; virtual displays cannot validate real
drivers, multiple monitors, suspend/resume, or fractional scaling.

`DIRI_DIST_DIR`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `DIRI_VERSION`, and
`DIRI_LINUX_FORMATS=appimage,deb` can override the defaults. Linux release
artifacts must come from the CI run for the exact release commit. The macOS
release script fetches them from a Nightly run on that commit (dispatching one
if needed), or takes `DIRI_LINUX_DIST` pointing at a downloaded artifact
directory; the release is then created once with both platforms' immutable
assets.

### Linux signatures

The Nightly `linux-package` job signs the AppImage, the Debian package,
`SHA256SUMS`, and `linux-release.json` with Sigstore keyless signing
(`scripts/linux-signatures.sh sign`), then verifies them before uploading.
cosign exchanges the job's GitHub OIDC token for a short-lived certificate
whose identity is
`https://github.com/cristicretu/diri/.github/workflows/nightly.yml@refs/heads/main`,
and records the signature in the public Rekor transparency log. Each file gets
a `<file>.sigstore.json` bundle. Only `main` runs sign; pull-request runs do
not. The Ubuntu 24.04 smoke job verifies the bundles again on a machine that
did not sign them, and `release.sh` verifies them with the pinned identity
before publishing, so an unsigned or wrongly signed Linux artifact cannot ship.
The release carries CI's signed Linux checksum list as `SHA256SUMS-linux`
beside the release-wide `SHA256SUMS`, which `release.sh` writes on the Mac and
therefore cannot carry a CI signature. User commands are in
[`LINUX.md`](LINUX.md#install).

Why Sigstore rather than a long-lived GPG or minisign key:

- **No key to keep.** The packages are built in CI, so the strongest statement
  available is "this workflow on `main` built these bytes", and keyless
  signing states exactly that. A GPG or minisign key would have to live in a
  GitHub secret, where anyone able to exfiltrate it could sign anything until
  it is revoked, and losing it strands every user who pinned its fingerprint.
- **Tamper evidence.** Every signature is in a public, append-only log, so a
  signature made outside this workflow would be visible.
- **Cost to users.** Verification needs `cosign`, which Ubuntu does not
  preinstall, whereas it does ship `gpg`. That is the main tradeoff, and the
  reason plain `SHA256SUMS` stays the first instruction.
- **Debian.** `dpkg-sig` is unmaintained and dpkg does not check embedded
  `.deb` signatures by default (`debsig-verify` is opt-in policy), so signing
  inside the package would protect almost nobody. The Debian-native trust path
  is a signed APT repository `InRelease` file whose key is installed with
  `signed-by`; that needs repository hosting and a long-lived GPG key, and is a
  separate decision (see "Not yet" below).
- **AppImage.** appimagetool can embed a GPG signature, but cargo-packager
  does not produce one, it again needs a long-lived key, and few tools check
  it. A detached bundle covers the same bytes.

Rehearse the path locally with a throwaway key, never a release key:

```sh
export COSIGN_PASSWORD=
cosign generate-key-pair --output-key-prefix "$TMPDIR/rehearsal"
DIRI_COSIGN_KEY="$TMPDIR/rehearsal.key" scripts/linux-signatures.sh sign <dist>
DIRI_COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY="$TMPDIR/rehearsal.pub" scripts/linux-signatures.sh verify <dist>
```

Key mode stays offline and never uploads to the transparency log. `release.sh`
clears both variables before its own verification, and needs `cosign` on the
release Mac (`brew install cosign`).

Not yet: an APT repository with a signed `InRelease` (so `apt upgrade`
verifies updates), GitHub build-provenance attestations, and aarch64 packages.
The in-app updater does not download Linux artifacts (it tells Linux users to
update through APT or a newer download), so it has nothing to verify. If a
Linux self-updater is ever added, it must verify these bundles against the same
pinned identity.

## macOS

`scripts/package.sh` builds `diri` for Apple silicon and Intel, combines the two slices with `lipo`, asks cargo-packager to assemble `dist/diri.app`, and signs the result. The bundle identifier is `com.dirijor.diri`, the deployment target is macOS 15.0, and the app does not use App Sandbox.

## One-time setup

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin \
    aarch64-unknown-linux-musl x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo install cargo-packager --locked
brew install zig
cargo install cargo-zigbuild --locked
```

The two musl targets, `zig`, and `cargo-zigbuild` are **required to cut a
release**, not optional. The app bundles one remote Helper binary per supported
remote platform, and `package.sh` fails rather than shipping a partial catalog:
a Helper the remote host cannot run means that host simply does not work. Only
the two Linux targets are cross-built; the Apple Helper needs a macOS builder,
which is why releases are cut on macOS. CI asserts all three artifacts are
present in the bundle.

`package.sh` uses the toolchain in `~/.cargo` and builds into `<workspace>/target`. Override either with `CARGO_HOME` or `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` — but never point `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at a cache shared with another checkout: cross-workspace fingerprint collisions link stale crates into the shipped app.

Also required: cargo-packager 0.11 or newer, Xcode command-line tools, `lipo`, `codesign`, `sips`, and `iconutil`.

## Local package and install

```sh
scripts/package.sh
scripts/install-local.sh
```

With no signing environment, `package.sh` applies an ad-hoc hardened-runtime signature and verifies it. Set `DIRI_CREATE_DMG=1` to also create `dist/diri-<version>-universal.dmg`. `DIRI_DIST_DIR` changes the output directory, and `DIRI_VERSION` changes the DMG filename.

The app icon's source of truth is the Icon Composer documents
`assets/diri.icon` (release) and `assets/diri-dev.icon` (development builds). The
compiled outputs are committed so packaging needs no Xcode 26+: `Assets.car` /
`dev-Assets.car` are what macOS 26+ draws (light, dark, tinted and clear
appearances, named by `CFBundleIconName`), `icon.icns` / `dev-icon.icns` are the
macOS 15 fallback, and `icon.png` feeds the Linux packages. After editing either
`.icon`, regenerate them all with `scripts/build-icons.sh`.

## Developer ID signing and notarization

Set the Developer ID Application identity and choose one notarytool authentication method:

```sh
export DIRI_SIGN_IDENTITY='Developer ID Application: Example Team (TEAMID)'
export DIRI_CREATE_DMG=1
export APPLE_NOTARIZATION_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=dirijor-notary
scripts/package.sh
```

The keychain-profile variable also accepts the legacy `NOTARY_PROFILE` name and cargo-packager's `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` name. Alternatively, set all three direct credential variables:

- `APPLE_NOTARIZATION_APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD` (an app-specific password)
- `APPLE_NOTARIZATION_TEAM_ID`

The cargo-packager-compatible aliases `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are also accepted. The script signs with the hardened runtime, then notarizes in two passes: the `.app` first (submitted as a zip, then stapled), and the DMG second, built from that already-stapled bundle. Both artifacts therefore carry a ticket that validates offline — which the in-app updater requires, since it assesses the bundle it extracts rather than the DMG. It never reads or submits credentials unless one of these notarization configurations is explicitly present.

Notarizing also produces `dist/diri-<version>-universal.zip`, the artifact diri's updater downloads. `DIRI_CREATE_ZIP=1` builds it without notarization too. The version in both artifact names comes from `crates/diri-app/Cargo.toml` unless `DIRI_VERSION` overrides it, because the updater compares against `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.

## Distribution checklist

Before a public release:

1. Install the real Developer ID Application certificate and configure a notarytool keychain profile or CI secrets.
2. Run the signed/notarized DMG flow and test it on a second Mac outside the build environment.
3. Publish through the release host with `scripts/release.sh <version>`, which wraps this script and also writes the update feed — see [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md).
