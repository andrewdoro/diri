//! DIRI PATCH (frame statistics): where one window frame's CPU time went.
//!
//! `Window::draw` stamps each phase of the frame it builds and counts the
//! views it renders and replays. Diri reads the finished frame's numbers for
//! telemetry and, from inside the frame's own paint pass, the phases that have
//! already finished. It costs a few `Instant::now()` calls and integer
//! increments per frame, never per element.

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

/// One window frame, by phase. Phases are contiguous: `layout` runs from the
/// start of `Window::draw` to the end of the root's layout request, `prepaint`
/// from there to the end of prepaint (deferred draws and tooltips included),
/// `paint` to the end of the scene, `a11y` to the end of the accessibility
/// update and `finish` to the end of `Window::draw` (sorting the scene,
/// swapping frames, focus listeners).
